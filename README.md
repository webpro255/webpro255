💻 I recently created a **interesting app** that uses AI to classify event logs. 

1. It uses **AI** to classify event logs and highlight anomalies.  
2. Built using **Python** with an interactive GUI.  
3. First-of-its-kind logger designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts!

## 📹 **Event Log with AI in Action!**
